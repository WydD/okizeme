    <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>So what's this about?</dt>
        <dd>This table represents every situations (or at the most common ones) in the wake-up mind-game for Street Fighter V.</dd>
        <dt>What for?</dt>
        <dd>SFV needs quick decision making, and from what I've seen, even people at Gold Level still have a hard time to understand how some situations behave. So I created all situations, now you can see them in action and perfectly executed.</dd>
        <dt>How can it actually be useful?</dt>
        <dd>Try to answer the question "should I backdash or should I jump to avoid a potential throw?" in 10s. I know I learned one or two things while doing this and I'm gold so most people should benefit from this.</dd>
        <dt>How perfect the input are?</dt>
        <dd>They are exactly as described in the later sections. I've created a laboratory to inject frame-by-frame inputs from both sides.</dd>
        <dt>How perfect should the input be?</dt>
        <dd>That depends on the situation of course, here I suppose the inputs are perfect, for instance if you're going for a DP but you're not reversal it's not in the chart.</dd>
        <dt>You said that the attacker is now on advantage but the defender is blocking.</dt>
        <dd>If you are attacking and you are on block you still have the initiative, that's something to take into account and that why the empty hourglass icon is here to represent.</dd>
        <dt>Why did you pick those characters?</dt>
        <dd>Cammy is my main so I know here normals and options well. Ryu has a typical DP and a 3f DP with the right hitbox to show off what I wanted to demonstrate on Safe Jumps and instant overheads. Zangief is the most obvious choice for grabbing and he has the fastest special grab (CA).</dd>
        <dt>Can you share the tool you used to replicate those experiment?</dt>
        <dd>Yes? No? Maybe. For now, I have trouble sharing code that can be used for cheating purposes but I may change my opinion on that.</dd>
        <dt>There is something wrong!</dt>
        <dd>My inputs are perfect but my reasoning may not be and the way I created may not be as well. Talking to me about it on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/WydD">@WydD</a> or on reddit /u/-WydD-</dd>
        <dt>You are missing one weird OS.</dt>
        <dd>Well I'm not for sophisticated OS here, I already put the Jump Tech OS and the Jump Cancel VT which are already very specific and should be used carefully. But tell me about it and I'll consider and it.</dd>
        <dt>You are missing this character specific wake-up action.</dt>
        <dd>For instance, it can be possible to punish a whiffed throw with jump (a dive for instance). But that would make the analysis too complex so I left those options out.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>General Remarks</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Some situations are character specific!</dt>
        <dd>For instance, Instant Overhead vs Invincible Reversal whiffs. This is NOT a general rule, but that's something that should be considered that some situations are weird because of hitboxes.</dd>
        <dt>You still need to think!</dt>
        <dd>If you blindly apply the table like a dummy you will do DPs because it's the most preferable defense and you will do meaties or instant overheads all the time. Well for one, instant overheads put you in negative after hit and secondly this is still a mind-game! So applying stuff by rule sets is always a bad idea. This just give you tools to assess a situation.</dd>
        <dt>Only the first level of the situations is provided.</dt>
        <dd>Those situations pretty much covers all that is possible to do without taking into account what your adversary is doing (because of reaction time). If the attacker does a light, that you block and go for a throw, that's something that is not covered because more that 20 frames passed after the wake-up and the possible situations count explodes.</dd>
        <dt>Frame advantage and distance matter.</dt>
        <dd>While it's hard to assess the better option between two, the result can not be binary. The perfect example is the Jump Tech OS which is most often a bad decision in terms of initiative, but it's the choice that puts you the most far from your opponent where initiative won't matter.</dd>
        <dt>Actions are performed by a dummy bot.</dt>
        <dd>Hence, the situation Safe Jump vs Throw hits but any decent player would never tech throw a jumping opponent.</dd>
        <dt>After a given input, the bot will defend.</dt>
        <dd>It will guard high if needed. That's why Cammy blocks in Throw vs Jump. But be aware that she still has advantage and can counter after the throw whiff.</dd>

        Read instructions: the sequence <code>[15, DOWN, LK], [1, DOWN, BACK, LP]</code> can be read as "I press 2LK for 15 frames and then I press 1LP for 1 frame".

                <dd>The guard is 5 frames to counter most DP, but Cammy's HK Cannon Strike is 6 frames so it will depend. This is one of the shortest setup you can get. The delay actually influences Delayed vs Delayed situations so you should be aware of what happens.</dd>

                <dd>I did a neutral jump with a HP to take into account punish a strong punish. If you want to do a jump out, do a Jump Tech OS. Be aware that for normal throw whiffs, you will not have time to punish your opponent. The quickest 8HP that wont whiff is 25f of delay but will depend on character (and it's still not fast enough to not be punished by Cammy's 4MP).</dd>

                <dd>Guard the meaty, jump out or avoid being thrown. If jump out, this will do a 9LK which can hit.</dd>

                <dd>You won't be affected by meaty throws. We jump 3 frames because the meaty throw happens on the 3rd frame (and after that it is not cancelable anymore). Juri can also cancel but her V-Trigger is not an attack so it will only give her an edge to have time to read your opponent. See <a href="https://twitter.com/TOOLASSlSTED/status/767968279231168512">@TOOLASSISTED</a> study on this.</dd>
